# Send application logs to EFK on OpenShift

This example provides two mechanism to sending applications logs to logging instance deployed on OpenShift v4 Cluster.

The sample application used in this example it's a simple container Hello World web page runnig on Apache HTTP Server with the ubi 8 base image.

For the exercise, it is proposed to record the access log output generated by the apache web server using 2 techniques:

- In the first scenario, a sidecar is generated that directly displays the access log output to stdout using the operating system tail command.
- In the second scenario, the Dockerfile file is modified, adding the instructions to replace the access and error log outputs to the standard output in the httpd.conf file. The modified Dockerfile is located in the logs-to-stdout branch

## Prerequisites

- Access to an OCP v4 Cluster.
- oc client installed.
- RedHat OpenShift Logging Operator deployed on OCP v4 Cluster.
- Access to Kibana UI (for validation only).

## Create the demo project

Login to your OCP Cluster via ocp

```bash
$ oc login -u youruser -p yourpassword cluster_api_url
```

Create the logging-demo-project

```bash
$ oc new-project logging-demo
Now using project "logging-demo" on server "cluster_api_url".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/serve_hostname
```

## First scenario: Sending logs with a sidecar container

Create simple-apache application from git via oc

```bash
$ oc new-app --name simple-apache https://github.com/jvarela01/logging-demo --strategy=docker -n logging-demo
--> Found container image 11f9dba (22 months old) from registry.access.redhat.com for "registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:8.0"

    Red Hat Universal Base Image 8 
    ------------------------------ 
    The Universal Base Image is designed and engineered to be the base layer for all of your containerized applications, middleware and utilities. This base image is freely redistributable, but Red Hat only supports Red Hat technologies through subscriptions for Red Hat products. This image is maintained by Red Hat and updated regularly.

    Tags: base rhel8

    * An image stream tag will be created as "ubi:8.0" that will track the source image
    * A Docker build using source code from https://github.com/jvarela01/logging-demo will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag "simple-apache:latest"
      * Every time "ubi:8.0" changes a new build will be triggered

    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
